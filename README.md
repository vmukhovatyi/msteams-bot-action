# Microsoft Teams Bot Action for GitHub

This GitHub Action allows you to send proactive messages to a Microsoft Teams channel via the Bot Framework API. It is especially useful for CI/CD pipelines or any automated process where you want to notify your team directly in Teams.

---

## Dependencies & Setup

To use this GitHub Action, you must configure several Microsoft Azure and Teams components:

### 1. Azure App Registration

- Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) â†’ "App registrations"
- Create a new application, or request it to be registred for you (depending on your org. setup and prcesses)
- Mark down for later:
  - `Application (client) ID`
  - `Directory (tenant) ID`

### 2. Microsoft Bot Service

- TODO: Create this part after trying IAC way

### 3. Add Bot to Teams

- Add the bot to your Team manually via Microsoft Teams UI
- Once added to the Team, it can send messages to **any channel** without requiring any api permissions set at Entra ID
- TODO: this section has to be explaned better

### 4. Federated Credentials (GitHub OIDC)

Go to your App Registration â†’ "Certificates & secrets" â†’ "Federated credentials":

- Federated credential scenario: Other issuer
- Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Audience: already preset but make sure it's this **api://AzureADTokenExchange**
- Value: **Claims matching expression**, you can use a filtered expression like:

```
claims['sub'] matches 'repo:your-org/team-repo-prefix-*:ref:refs/heads/*'
```

This allows any repo and each branch of that repo under your org and prefixed with `team-repo-prefix-` to use this token.

---

## Token Authentication Note

GitHubâ€™s federated tokens cannot be exchanged via standard OBO (on-behalf-of) flows due to Microsoft restrictions.

Instead, we use a workaround via **JWT assertion** flow to authenticate using GitHub-issued identity token.
